# go-multierror

`go-multierror` is a package for Go that provides a mechanism for
representing a list of `error` values as a single `error`.

This allows a function in Go to return an `error` that might actually
be a list of errors. If the caller knows this, they can unwrap the
list and access the errors. If the caller doesn't know, the error
formats to a nice human-readable format.

`go-multierror` implements the
[errwrap](https://github.com/hashicorp/errwrap) interface so that it can
be used with that library, as well.
